A URL Shortener is a tool or application that converts long and complex URLs into shorter, more manageable links while still redirecting users to the original URL when accessed. It is widely used for sharing links on social media, emails, or text messages where space is limited. Popular services include Bitly, TinyURL, and Googleâ€™s (now retired) URL shortener.

Key Features of a URL Shortener
Shortened Links:

Transforms long URLs (e.g., https://example.com/some/very/long/path) into short ones (e.g., http://short.ly/abc123).
Redirection:

When someone accesses the short URL, the system redirects them to the original long URL using a lookup from the database.

Click Tracking:
Tracks the number of times a shortened URL is clicked, providing analytics about link usage.

Custom Short Links:
Users can create custom short codes (e.g., http://short.ly/myLink).

How It Works
-User Inputs Long URL:
  The user enters a long URL into the system.
-Generate a Shortened Code:
  The system creates a unique short code (e.g., a random string or hash).
-Save in Database:
  The original URL, short code, and click count are stored in a database.
-Redirect Logic:
  When someone accesses the short link, the system looks up the database for the corresponding long URL and redirects the user.
